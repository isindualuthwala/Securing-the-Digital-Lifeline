## Abstract
— Next generation medical devices increasingly operate within the Internet of Medical Things, improving care while expanding the attack surface. This review synthesizes research on three pillars that determine device resilience: firmware integrity, software supply-chain risk and penetration testing in clinical contexts. It summarizesevidence and techniques for trustworthy boot and authenticated software loading; analyzes update and maintenance practices for ling-lived devices, including risks inheriting from third party components; and distills lessons from foundational attack demonstrations on implantable and wearable systems that motivate safety aware testing. Cross cutting themes include the need for authenticated and traceable firmware updates; lifecycle transparency to accelerate vulnerability triage and adjunct protections such as external anomaly monitoring and secure auxiliary channels. The review concludes by outlining focused directions for future work; verifiable update pipelines for constrained platforms, lightweight attestation that preserves emergency access, automation of component transparency and vulnerability matching, hardening patterns for legacy deployments and standardized, bench-safe penetration testing methods that map directly to clinical impact.
